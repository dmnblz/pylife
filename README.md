### Simulation of 2D cells
(or at least I hope so)

all particles can be grabbed with left mouse click

- o = add a single loose particle
- p = add 10 loose particles


- k = decrease spring stiffness by 50
- l = increase spring stiffness by 50

 
- n = decrease temperature by 50
- m = increase temperature by 50


- q = freeze loose particles 
- w = unfreeze loose particles
